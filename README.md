# Automated Surface Crack Detection for Quality Control

> End-to-end deep learning system for detecting surface cracks using transfer learning with pretrained CNN architectures (ResNet50, InceptionV3, VGG16). Designed for automated defect detection in construction materials.

---

## ðŸ§© Overview

This project implements an automated crack detection pipeline for quality control applications. Using transfer learning on pretrained models, it identifies surface cracks from high-resolution images of concrete and other construction materials.

The system was trained on **25,000 labeled crack images**, achieving **99.9% accuracy** with ResNet50.

## ðŸ§  Training

Train using ResNet50 as baseline:

```bash
python src/train.py --model resnet50 --epochs 20 --batch-size 32 --lr 0.0001
```

Training steps:

1. Load pretrained CNN (ImageNet weights)
2. Replace final classification layer (Dense â†’ 2 classes)
3. Freeze early layers; fine-tune last convolutional blocks
4. Train on crack dataset

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation

Evaluate trained models:

```bash
python src/evaluate.py --model models/resnet50_model.h5 --data data/test/
```

Outputs:

* Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
* Confusion matrix visualization
* Per-class performance summary

**Results:**

| Model    | Accuracy  | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| -------- | --------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| ResNet50 | **99.9%** | 99.8%     | 99.9%  |          |
